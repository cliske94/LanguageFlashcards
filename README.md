Language Learning Game

<h1>Scope of Project</h1>

This is a monolithic java application, complete with GUI and a database consisting of text files, that allows the user to choose
from six variations of a flashcard language learning game. This project demonstrates a working knowledge of data structures and 
object oriented design patterns. Depending on the button pressed on the initial GUI frame, the user is provided flashcards with 
words in English, italian, or German and the user has a few seconds to type the translation before the flashcard is locked and the 
answer is displayed. Correct entries increase the tally in the top corner.
